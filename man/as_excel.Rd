\description{
The \code{\link[=as_excel]{as_excel()}} function relies on the \code{openxlsx2} package for creating an Excel Workbook object in R. These objects can be saved using \code{\link[=save_excel]{save_excel()}} or \code{\link[=export_xlsx]{export_xlsx()}}.
}
\section{Supported Table Styles}{

For the argument \code{table_style}, use one or more of these table styles as character input. The default is \strong{TableStyleMedium2}.
